<h1>Week 1: Introduction to Data Visualization Tools</h1>



<h2>Introduction to Data Visualization</h2>


<h3>Introduction to Matplotlib</h3>

Matplotlib's architecture is composed of three main layers:

- _The back-end layer_

- _The artist layer:_ where much of the heavy lifting happens and is usually the appropriate programming paradigm when writing a web application server, or a UI application, or perhaps a script to be shared with other developers.

- _The scripting layer:_ which is the appropriate layer for everyday purposes and is considered a lighter scripting interface to simplify common tasks and for a quick and easy generation of graphics and plots.
