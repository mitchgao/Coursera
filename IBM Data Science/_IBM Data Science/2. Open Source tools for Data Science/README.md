<h1>WEEK 1</h1>



<h2>Introducing Skills Network Labs</h2>

<h3>What is Skills Network Labs?</h3>

Skills Network Labs, previously known as Data Scientist Workbench or BDU Labs. It's a free virtual lab environment that lets you practice your skills in Python, R, and more, while you learn data science.

Skills Network Labs is an environment that contains tools such as RStudio, Jupyter Notebook, and Zeppelin Notebook. These tools provides an interactive environment for you to perform data analysis, data visualization, machine learning and image recognition.

It's ready to use in your web browser. So without having to install anything on your computer, you can immediately start using popular data science tools like RStudio IDE, Jupyter Notebooks, Apache Zeppelin and more. Skills Network Labs is also the virtual lab environment for [cognitiveclass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai/), a popular website with lots of free online courses in data science, artificial intelligence, and data engineering.

<h3>Account Features</h3>

You can access Skills Network Labs with [labs.cognitiveclass.ai](https://labs.cognitiveclass.ai/).

<h2>WEEK 2</h2>


<h2>Apache Zeppelin Notebooks</h2>

<h3>What are Zeppelin Notebooks?</h3>

Zeppelin notebooks is one of the open-source, web-based tools in Data Scientist Workbench. Zeppelin notebooks are multipurpose notebooks that can handle all your analytics needs, from data ingestion, data discovery, data analytics, to data visualization and collaboration. The Zeppelin interpreter concept allows any language or data processing backend to be plugged into Zeppelin. Currently Apache Zeppelin supports many interpreters such as Apache Spark, Python, JDBC, Markdown, and Shell.

Apache Zeppelin, in particular, provides built-in Apache Spark integration. You don't need to build a separate module, plug-in, or library for it. Apache Zeppelin with Spark integration provides a number of great features including automatic Spark context and SQL context injection. Runtime JAR dependency loading from local file system or Maven repository, as well as cancelling job and progress display.


<h2>RStudio IDE</h2>

<h3>What is RStudio IDE?</h3>

RStudio IDE is one of the open source web-based tools in Data Scientist Workbench. It allows you to analyze data, take advantage of many statistical packages and create beautiful visualizations and web applications. As its name suggests, RStudio IDE is only for R. Like other IDEs, in RStudio IDE, you can code in a console or script editor, keep track of your variables and history, display your plots, manage your packages and see help documentation for R. If you're an R user, you'll already be familiar with this type of setup, where you can analyze data, see your console and visualize your plots and graphs all in the same environment. Another great feature is that you'll also have access to Apache Spark. By simply typing SC from the editor or console and running it, you'll see that you can run Spark R code to analyze big data. Taking it a step further, R also gives you access to a Shiny library, which you can use to make your visualizations interactive. Using Shiny, you can create all sorts of web-based interactive apps just using R code. To open RStudio IDE, simply click the RStudio IDE button on the Data Scientist Workbench home page.
